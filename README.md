### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**TomCoulais/tomcoulais** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my portfolio
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning tailwindcss
- âš¡Fun fact: I love coffee because I'm a student in IT! It's the perfect fuel for those late-night coding sessions and debugging marathons. Plus, it helps me stay focused and alert while tackling complex programming problems.
